# Optim: Emergency Department Symptom Classifier


## Overview
Optim is an innovative project developed for the **IndabaX BÃ©nin 2023 Hackathon** aimed at enhancing the efficiency of emergency departments (EDs). Utilizing a ChatGPT-powered chat interface, Optim classifies patients based on the severity of their symptoms, enabling quicker and more accurate triage decisions.

## How It Works

* **Input:** Users enter symptoms using natural language. They can describe their condition in their own words, just like talking to a doctor.
* **Processing:** The ChatGPT model interprets the input, identifying key symptoms and their implied severity.
* **Output:** The system categorizes the case into a severity level (e.g., High, Medium, Low Urgency)

## Advantages
**Accessibility:** User-friendly for people of all ages and tech-heaviness.
**Efficiency:** Speeds up the triage process by providing instant preliminary assessments.
**Accuracy:** Utilizes the extensive knowledge base of ChatGPT to understand a wide range of medical symptoms and conditions.
